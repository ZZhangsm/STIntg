## 🎯 Overview

![STUltra_Overview](https://github.com/ZZhangsm/STUltra/blob/main/overview.jpg)

High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) generates large-scale datasets across multiple tissue sections, developmental stages, and disease conditions, making integration challenging due to biological heterogeneity and batch effects.

**STUltra** is a scalable hypergraph framework for multi-sample ST integration, spatial domain detection, and GWAS-based trait mapping. By combining interval-sampled hypergraphs, robust graph representation learning, and contrastive learning, STUltra learns batch-corrected spatial embeddings that enable accurate domain identification and disease trait mapping across integrated tissue landscapes.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Million-scale Scalability**: Efficiently processes datasets containing over **1,000,000** spatial locations
- 🔄 **Cross-platform Integration**: Supports Visium HD, Xenium, Stereo-seq, and other high-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms
- 🧩 **Robust Batch Correction**: Integrates samples across spatial, temporal, and biological conditions while reducing batch effects
- 🧬 **Disease Trait Mapping**: Integrates GWAS summary statistics to identify trait-associated spatial domains across tissues

> **📢 Note:** The GWAS trait mapping module is currently being cleaned up and documented. The corresponding code will be released in a later update.
